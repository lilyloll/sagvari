    <p>Some deep context i wanna share</p>
    <a target="_blank" href="https://youtu.be/_JGGLJMpVks"> billie eilish - tv</a>
    <p>I don't wanna talk right now
      I just wanna watch TV
      I'll stay in the pool and drown
      So I don't have to watch you leave
      I put on Survivor just to watch somebody suffer
      Maybe I should get some sleep
      Sinking in the sofa while they all betray each other
      What's the point of anything?
      All of my friends are missing again
      That's what happens when you fall in love
      You don't have the time, you leave them all behind
      You tell yourself it's fine, you're just in love
      Don't know where you are right now
      Did you see me on TV?
      I'll try not to starve myself
      Just because you're mad at me
      And I'll be in denial for at least a little while
      What about the plans we made?
      The internet's gone wild watching movie stars on trial
      While they're overturning Roe v. Wade
      Now all of my friends are missing again
      'Cause that's what happens when you fall in love
      You don't have the time, you leave them all behind
      And you tell yourself it's fine, you're just in love
      And I don't get along with anyone
      Maybe I'm the problem
      Maybe I'm the problem
      Maybe I, maybe I, maybe I'm the problem
      Maybe I, maybe I, maybe I'm the problem
      Maybe I, maybe I, maybe I'm the problem
      Maybe I, maybe I, maybe I'm the problem
      Maybe I, maybe I, maybe I'm the problem
      Maybe I, maybe I, maybe I'm the problem
      Baby, I, baby, I, baby, I'm the problem
      Baby, I, baby, I, baby, I'm the problem
      Baby, I, baby, I, baby, I'm the problem
      Baby, I, baby, I, baby, I'm the problem
      Baby, I, baby, I, baby, I'm the problem</p>
